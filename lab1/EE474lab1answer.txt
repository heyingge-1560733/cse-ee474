EE474 Lab1 Question
Yueyang Cheng & Freddie He

Question 1.  What happened to the blink rate? Why?

When we increase the delay time, the blink rate of the LED decreases.
When we decrease the delay time, the blink rate of the LED increases.

Question 2. How many bits wide is the default ADC data output in the MK20DX256?

16 bits wide.

Question 3. How many bits do you need for the delay, and how do you calculate the delay?

10 bits. ADC converter convert analog to digital, thus 5V is converted to 1023 and 0V is converted to 0.
The equation to calculate the delay time is delay time = (analog voltage / 5.0) * 1023(ms).

Question 4. How do you change the sample width (number of bits in the digital output of the ADC)?

We can change the sample width by using code analogReadResolution(value). 
The code analogReadResolution(value) can extend default 10 bits up to 16 bits.
